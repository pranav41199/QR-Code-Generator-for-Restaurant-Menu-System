# QR-Code-Generator-for-Restaurant-Menu-System
This project is a web-based application designed to digitize the restaurant menu system by generating QR codes for easy access to the menu. Built using Django (a Python web framework) and Python, this project streamlines menu management and enhances the customer dining experience by allowing patrons to view the menu directly on their mobile devices by scanning a QR code.
